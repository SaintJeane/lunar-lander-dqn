## 🎯 Overview

The LunarLander environment challenges an agent to land a spacecraft safely on a landing pad by controlling its main and side thrusters. The agent receives a continuous 8-dimensional state vector and must select one of 4 discrete actions at each timestep.

**Environment Details:**
- **State Space:** 8 dimensions (position, velocity, angle, angular velocity, leg contact)
- **Action Space:** 4 discrete actions (do nothing, left engine, main engine, right engine)
- **Reward:** +100 for landing, -100 for crashing, fuel consumption penalties
- **Solved Criteria:** Average reward ≥ 200 over 100 consecutive episodes

## 🧠 Algorithm

This implementation uses **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm that approximates the optimal action-value function Q*(s,a) using a deep neural network.

### DQN Update Rule

```
Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α[r + γ max Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
                              a'
```

Where:
- `s, a`: current state and action
- `r`: reward received
- `s'`: next state
- `γ`: discount factor (0.99)
- `α`: learning rate (0.001)

### Key Components

1. **Experience Replay Buffer**
   - Stores transitions (s, a, r, s', done) in a circular buffer
   - Breaks correlation between consecutive samples
   - Improves sample efficiency and training stability
   - Capacity: 100,000 transitions

2. **Target Network**
   - Separate network for computing target Q-values
   - Updated every 10 training steps
   - Stabilizes training by providing fixed targets
   - Prevents oscillation and divergence

3. **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**
   - Balances exploration vs exploitation
   - ε starts at 1.0 (random actions)
   - Decays by 0.995 per episode
   - Minimum ε = 0.01

## 🏗️ Neural Network Architecture

- **Hidden Layer 1:** 128 neurons with ReLU activation
- **Hidden Layer 2:** 128 neurons with ReLU activation

After training for 2000 episodes, the DQN agent successfully learns to land the lunar lander:

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Best Average Reward:** ~250+ (over 100 episodes)
- **Success Rate:** >95% (episodes with reward ≥ 200)

- **Episodes to Solve:** ~800-1200 episodes

### Learning Curve

The agent shows consistent improvement:
- **Episodes 0-500:** Exploration phase, highly variable rewards
- **Episodes 500-1000:** Rapid learning, average reward increases
- **Episodes 1000-2000:** Convergence, stable high performance

### Sample Evaluation Results

## 🔬 Technical Details

### DQN Algorithm Flow

1. **Initialize** policy and target networks with random weights
2. **Initialize** replay buffer D
3. **For each episode:**
   - Reset environment, get initial state s
   - **For each step:**
     - Select action a using ε-greedy policy
     - Execute action, observe reward r and next state s'
     - Store transition (s, a, r, s', done) in D
     - Sample random minibatch from D
     - Compute target: y = r + γ max Q_target(s', a')
     - Update policy network: minimize (y - Q_policy(s, a))²
     - Every C steps: update target network
   - Decay ε

### Loss Function

We use Smooth L1 Loss (Huber Loss) for better stability:

```python
L = {
  0.5 * (y - Q(s,a))²           if |y - Q(s,a)| ≤ 1
  |y - Q(s,a)| - 0.5            otherwise
}
```

This is less sensitive to outliers than MSE while maintaining differentiability.

### Gradient Clipping

To prevent exploding gradients:

```python
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(parameters, max_norm=1.0)
```

## 🎯 Future Improvements

   - Learn exploration strategy
   - Better for hard exploration problems
